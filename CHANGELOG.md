# Unreleased changes

# 0.6.0 (_2020-12-08)

## ⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️

- Removed `NimbusClient.resetEnrollment`.
- `NimbusClient.{updateExperiments, optInWithBranch, optOut, setGlobalUserParticipation}` now return a list of telemetry events.
  Consumers should forward these events to their telemetry system (e.g. via Glean).
- Removed implicit fetch of experiments on first use of the database. Consumers now must
  call update_experiments explicitly in order to fetch experiments from the Remote Settings
  server.

## What's Changed

- Addition of schema version to the schema, and validation of supported versions by the SDK.

# 0.5.1 (_2020-11-10)

## What's Changed

- Fix the version number in `Cargo.lock`.

# 0.5.0 (_2020-11-10)

## What's New

- Added support for global opt-out via new method
  `NimbusClient.set_global_user_participation(bool)`

## What's Changed

- Updated uniffi and rkv dependencies to their latest
  release versions.
- Switched to using the "safe mode" backend for rkv;
  this can be disabled at build time by disabling the
  `rkv-safe-mode` feature.


# 0.4.0 (_2020-11-06)

## What's Changed

- Removed use of unsigned types from the Kotlin API, since these
  are experimental and require opt-in from consuming apps.
