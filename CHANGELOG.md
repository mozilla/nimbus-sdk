# Unreleased changes

## General

Addition of schema version to the schema, and validation of supported versions by the SDK.

Removed implicit fetch of experiments on first use of the database. Consumers now must
call update_experiments explicitly in order to fetch experiments from the Remote Settings
server.

Removed `NimbusClient.resetEnrollment`.

`NimbusClient.{updateExperiments, optInWithBranch, optOut, setGlobalUserParticipation}` now return a list of telemetry events.

# 0.5.1 (_2020-11-10)

- Fix the version number in `Cargo.lock`.

# 0.5.0 (_2020-11-10)

- Added support for global opt-out via new method
  `NimbusClient.set_global_user_participation(bool)`
- Updated uniffi and rkv dependencies to their latest
  release versions.
- Switched to using the "safe mode" backend for rkv;
  this can be disabled at build time by disabling the
  `rkv-safe-mode` feature.


# 0.4.0 (_2020-11-06)

## General

### What's Fixed

- Removed use of unsigned types from the Kotlin API, since these
  are experimental and require opt-in from consuming apps.
- Fixed various warnings when compiling the Rust code.


# 0.3.0 (_2020-10-27_)
